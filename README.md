<h1 align="center">Textual 2048</h1>
<div style="text-align: center;">
I'm at University, 1st year, and for the end of this semester we got projects to do.
I chose the 2048 and here is my version.
</div>

---
The way I wrote my version of 2048 goes beyond the current level that the university assumes we have.  
Like classes, dictionaries, `lambda`, etc.

# How it works ?
There are 3 files : **2048_game.py**, **constants_2048.py** and **game_texts.json**.  
The first one is the main file which contains all necessary functions, second one contains 
all constants and the last contains all texts (not many).

Provide a detailed description on it will be useless, the project is pretty easy but enjoy it !
